# Compose course UI

A simple UI built using Jetpack Compose. Consists of a list screen & a details screen. 

Uses Compose Navigation, LazyColumns, Scaffold, and Coil for loading images from a URL. Wrote a custom util method that uses canvas to paint a gradient over text and icons. 

The util can be found in `drawGradientText.kt` under the utils folder.

Had a lot of fun creating 3D illustrations for this UI.
